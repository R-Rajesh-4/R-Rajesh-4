## My Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects I've worked on. Click on them to learn more!

### Abroad_Students_Data_Analysis
The "Abroad_Students_Data_Analysis" project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative focused on examining various aspects of students who pursue education abroad. This project involves collecting and analyzing data on students' demographics, countries of origin, destination countries, courses chosen, academic backgrounds, financial aspects, and the challenges faced during their education overseas.

### Adult-Salary-Prediction---Machine-Learning
The "Adult Salary Prediction" machine learning project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data. This project typically involves building and training a machine learning model on the "Adult" dataset, also known as the "Census Income" dataset, which contains information such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week. The main challenge is to accurately classify individuals into two income categories: those earning above and below $50,000 annually. This involves preprocessing the data, selecting appropriate features, choosing a suitable model (such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines), and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
